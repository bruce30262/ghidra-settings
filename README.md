# ghidra-settings
My own Ghidra settings, inlcuding:  
* key binding configuration file. Inspired by [ida2ghidra-kb](https://github.com/enovella/ida2ghidra-kb) ( the configuration file is modified from the one in ida2ghidra-kb ).  
* theme settings.

## Key bindings
I've modified the following key bindings to fit my needs. Currently works in Ghidra 10.3 ( 2023/06/10 ).  

| Action Name | Key Binding |
|---|---|
| Rename  Function/Variable | N |
| Retype Funtion/Variable | Y |
| Xref  | X |
| Goto previous location  | ESC  |
| Goto next location | Ctrl-Right  |
| Goto previous Function  | Alt-Left  |
| Goto next Function | Alt-Right  |
